# hexo-filter-markdown-auto-indent
This is the auto indenting filter for my hexo markdown article. It works very simply. Maybe I need to submit a pull request to the markdown renderer, and determine whether it works through configuration. This is my first time. It's settled for the time being.
# What does it do?
Add indent content that is not a p tag within a list element.
